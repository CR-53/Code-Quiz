04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


## Task Description

The task for this week's assignment was to create a JavaScript Coding Quiz using HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with the option to use jQuery. The quiz needed to include a timer and multiple choice questions. The timer also had to act as the player's score, with the timer (score) being reduced if a player answers a question incorrectly. After the final question is answered, the timer stops and that becomes the player's final score. The player is then presented with an input field to enter their name and a submit button for them to enter their score to the highscores list on a separate page.
